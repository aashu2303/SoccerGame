# SoccerGame
This game is like the Air Hockey game which we might have played physically. 
I tried to implement the game using python library called "Pygame".

Firstly, 
Make sure that you have Python installed in your machine. You can install the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ website.
